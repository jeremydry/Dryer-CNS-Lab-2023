This is the repository for all of Jeremy Dryer's CNS labs for this semester. Each lab will have its own folder in which all the relevent files will be located
The text editor I will be utilizing will be microsoft VS code as I am fimilair with it and it has a lot of useful plugins
I utilized the installer for vagrant as I am installing it on my windows machine. I downloaded the I686 and my vagrant is located at "C:\Users\JRDryer\Desktop\CNS Lab\Lab01\.vagrant"
